* Usage in the local environment
1. unzip file (assume the name of unziped directory is "MPCPrograms")
2. compile
[Terminal 1@MPCPrograms] $ make
3. run the program in each server
[Terminal 1@MPCPrograms] $ ./App.out 1
[Terminal 2@MPCPrograms] $ ./App.out 2
[Terminal 3@MPCPrograms] $ ./App.out 3

* Usage in 3-VM/physical machine environment
1. edit parties.conf and test.conf
 (see README.txt for the )
2. run the program
 - in the same way as local environment.

* Checking performance
The result of running programs is written in "Experiment.txt". 
(If you want to change the name of output file, edit "App.cc")
The result shows total running time of MPCCircuit::run function, and average time of one round of MPC. 
The position of each interval is written in "BIU_MPC_status_yyyymmdd.pptx". 
The parameters (the number of parallelization, the number of inputs) can be changed by "test.conf". 
First column of "test.conf" is the number of parallelization, and second column is the number of inputs. 
When the number of inputs is changed, you should remake "TestCircuit.txt". (see also README.txt)
